**Target roles:** Product Engineering, Applied AI

**Lead with:**

1. Speed of execution
2. Production experience
3. Entrepreneurial track record

**Note:** De-emphasize heart-centered philosophy, lead with pragmatic shipping

### Google DeepMind ⭐⭐⭐ Hardest Fit

**Why harder:**

- Most research-credentialed
- Academic papers/citations matter
- "Self-taught" narrative less valued

**Target roles:** Applied AI, Product teams (NOT research)

**Lead with:**

## Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about yourself"

"25-year Silicon Valley veteran, self-taught. Multiple CTO roles, ChangeTip acquired by
Airbnb. Pivoted hard into AI in 2023—it's the most important technology shift of my
career. Since then I've shipped: MCP Hubby (95% context reduction), Carmenta
(multi-model AI platform), machina (MCP gateway to Mac), ai-coding-config (24
specialized agents for Claude Code). I didn't just use AI—I built infrastructure for
it."

### "Why this company?"

**Anthropic:** "Constitutional AI resonates with work I've been doing independently.
HeartCentered.AI explores alignment through recognition rather than constraint. Plus,
I've built more production infrastructure for Claude than almost anyone outside
Anthropic—two MCP implementations, observability tooling, a plugin ecosystem."

**Vercel:** "Developer experience is my obsession. ai-coding-config exists because I
couldn't stop thinking about how developers interact with AI. Carmenta is built on your
entire stack—Next.js 16, Vercel AI SDK 6.0. I want to help you make AI accessible to
every developer."

### "What's your biggest technical achievement?"

"MCP Hubby's progressive disclosure pattern. The insight was that LLMs don't need 200
tools upfront—they need one tool that discovers operations on demand. 95% context
reduction. It sounds simple but getting the abstraction right across 25 different
service APIs while maintaining type safety and multi-account support—that's where the
engineering lived."
