# Cover Letter Template - Vercel

## Hook

Developer experience is my obsession. ai-coding-config exists because I couldn't stop
thinking about how developers interact with AI tools. Carmenta is built entirely on your
stack—Next.js 16, Vercel AI SDK 6.0, deployed on Vercel. When I needed the best tools
for AI development, I chose yours.

## Credibility

25-year Silicon Valley veteran. Self-taught. Multiple CTO roles, including ChangeTip
(acquired by Airbnb). I've shipped across crypto, fintech, and now AI infrastructure.
The throughline: making developers more productive through better tools and
abstractions.

## Why Vercel

You're making AI accessible to every developer. That's exactly what I've been working
toward independently:

- **Carmenta**: Full AI product platform with 7 frontier models, intelligent routing,
  and evaluation framework. Built on Next.js 16 + Vercel AI SDK 6.0. It's my production
  proof that your stack works.
- **ai-coding-config**: 24 specialized agents, 18 commands, 33 rules—all designed to
  make AI coding assistants genuinely useful. Cross-tool compatibility (Claude Code,
  Cursor, Windsurf, Cline).
- **MCP Hubby**: Infrastructure that makes AI tools work better together. Progressive
  disclosure pattern that reduced context usage by 95%.

## Proof Points

- **Carmenta**: Production AI platform. 7 models with intelligent routing. Braintrust
  evaluation framework. Real users, real feedback loops.
- **ai-coding-config**: The most comprehensive Claude Code plugin ecosystem. Shows deep
  understanding of what developers actually need from AI assistants.
- **MCP Hubby**: 25 service adapters, production OAuth 2.0. Demonstrates ability to
  build infrastructure that works at scale.

## Close

I want to help you make AI accessible to every developer. I've been building the tools
that prove it's possible—now I want to do it at the scale and impact that Vercel
enables.
