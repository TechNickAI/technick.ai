# Cover Letter Template - Anthropic

## Hook

I've implemented the MCP protocol twice in production—not because anyone asked me to,
but because I couldn't stop thinking about how to make AI tools more useful. MCP Hubby
achieves 95% context reduction through progressive disclosure. machina bridges Claude to
Mac capabilities with LLM-aware fuzzy matching. These aren't side projects; they're
production systems born from genuine obsession with developer experience.

## Credibility

25-year Silicon Valley veteran. Self-taught. Multiple CTO roles, including ChangeTip
(acquired by Airbnb). I've shipped across crypto, fintech, and now AI infrastructure.
What's changed since 2023: AI became the most important technology shift of my career,
and I went all-in on building infrastructure for it.

## Why Anthropic

Constitutional AI resonates with work I've been doing independently. HeartCentered.AI
explores alignment through recognition rather than constraint—using "we" language
instead of "you are an AI assistant." It's a complementary approach to the same goal: AI
that genuinely helps humans flourish.

But beyond philosophy: I've built more production infrastructure for Claude than almost
anyone outside Anthropic. Two MCP implementations, Claude Code observability tooling
(claude_telemetry), and what might be the most comprehensive Claude Code plugin
ecosystem (ai-coding-config: 24 specialized agents, 18 workflow commands, 33 coding
standards).

## Proof Points

- **MCP Hubby**: 95% context reduction via progressive disclosure. 25 service adapters.
  713 commits, 87 test files. Production-grade OAuth 2.0 with three-tier auth
  architecture.
- **machina**: MCP gateway for Mac capabilities. Fuzzy contact matching with Levenshtein
  distance. structuredContent for LLM-friendly responses.
- **ai-coding-config**: Claude Code plugin author. 24 specialized agents (security
  reviewer, debugger, UX designer, etc.). 304 commits.

## Close

I want to help make Claude the best AI development platform in the world. I've already
been building that infrastructure independently—now I want to do it at scale, with the
team that created the foundation.
