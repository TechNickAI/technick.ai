# Cover Letter Template - OpenAI

## Hook

I ship. 25 years of shipping. Multiple CTO roles. ChangeTip acquired by Airbnb. Since
2023, I've shipped MCP Hubby (95% context reduction), Carmenta (multi-model AI platform
with 7 frontier models), machina (MCP gateway for Mac), and ai-coding-config (24
specialized coding agents). I didn't just use AI—I built infrastructure for it.

## Credibility

Silicon Valley veteran. Self-taught. The kind of engineer who builds because they can't
help it. Production systems managing real capital (crypto trading algorithms). Deep
experience across Bitcoin/blockchain, fintech, and now AI infrastructure.

## Why OpenAI

You're moving fast, shipping constantly, and defining what AI can do. That matches how I
work. I've built multi-model systems (Carmenta routes to the right model for every
task), developer tools that work across ecosystems, and production infrastructure with
real stakes.

What I bring that's different: I'm not Claude-locked. Carmenta works with GPT-4, o1, and
other models alongside Claude. I understand the multi-model landscape and how to build
tools that work across it.

## Proof Points

- **Shipping velocity**: MCP Hubby (713 commits), Carmenta (full production platform),
  ai-coding-config (304 commits), machina—all shipped in the past 18 months.
- **Multi-model expertise**: Carmenta routes between 7 frontier models based on task
  requirements. I understand what each model does well.
- **Production judgment**: CryptoAI manages real capital with algorithmic trading.
  Production systems where mistakes cost money teach you different lessons than hobby
  projects.

## Close

I want to help build the tools that make AI useful for everyone. I've proven I can ship
fast and think across the multi-model landscape—now I want to do it where the biggest
impact is possible.

**Customize for specific role:** De-emphasize Claude-specific work for OpenAI. Lead with
shipping velocity and multi-model expertise. Emphasize pragmatism over philosophy.
