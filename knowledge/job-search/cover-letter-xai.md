# Cover Letter Template - xAI (Grok)

## Hook

I ship fast. In the past 18 months: MCP Hubby (95% context reduction, 713 commits),
Carmenta (full AI platform with 7 models), machina (MCP gateway for Mac),
ai-coding-config (24 specialized agents). I don't wait for permission—I build what needs
to exist.

## Credibility

25-year Silicon Valley veteran. Self-taught. Multiple CTO roles, startup founder,
ChangeTip acquired by Airbnb. Bitcoin since 2013. I've operated in spaces where moving
fast and making bold bets is the only way to win.

## Why xAI

You're building fast and shipping constantly. That matches how I work. No bureaucracy,
no committee decisions—just building and iterating in production.

What I bring:

- **Speed**: 4 major production systems shipped in 18 months
- **Production judgment**: Trading algorithms managing real capital—where mistakes cost
  money
- **Entrepreneurial track record**: Multiple ventures, acquisition exit, CTO experience

## Proof Points

- **Shipping velocity**: MCP Hubby went from idea to production with 25 service
  adapters. ai-coding-config evolved through 304 commits into a comprehensive agent
  ecosystem.
- **Production systems**: CryptoAI manages real capital with algorithmic trading.
  Carmenta serves real users with real feedback loops.
- **Bias toward action**: I built two MCP implementations not because someone
  asked—because I saw the opportunity and executed.

## Close

I want to help build AI products that matter. I've proven I can ship fast in ambiguous
environments—xAI is doing that at frontier scale.

**Customize for specific role:** Lead with speed and pragmatism. De-emphasize
heart-centered philosophy entirely. This is about shipping, execution, and results.
