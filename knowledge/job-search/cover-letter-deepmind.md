## Hook

Production AI systems with measurable outcomes. MCP Hubby reduced context usage by 95%
through a progressive disclosure pattern—a measurable improvement in how LLMs interact
with external tools. Carmenta implements intelligent model routing with a Braintrust
evaluation framework for systematic comparison.

## Credibility

25-year Silicon Valley veteran. Self-taught. Multiple CTO roles, including ChangeTip
(acquired by Airbnb). Production systems managing real capital with algorithmic trading.
Since 2023, focused entirely on AI infrastructure—building and measuring what works.

## Why DeepMind

You combine research rigor with production impact. My work sits at that intersection:
practical systems informed by deep thinking about what makes AI tools genuinely useful.

Key examples:

- **MCP Hubby's progressive disclosure**: An insight about LLM context efficiency turned
  into a measurable 95% reduction in token usage
- **Carmenta's evaluation framework**: Systematic comparison of model performance across
  task types using Braintrust
- **CryptoAI's algorithmic sophistication**: Trading algorithms with measurable
  performance metrics

## Proof Points

- **MCP Hubby**: Progressive disclosure pattern achieving 95% context reduction (7.5K vs
  200K tokens). Quantifiable improvement in LLM tool use efficiency.
- **Carmenta**: Multi-model platform with Braintrust evaluation framework. Systematic
  measurement of routing decisions.
- **CryptoAI**: Algorithmic trading with 82-95.7% win rates on prediction markets.
  Production systems with measurable outcomes.

## Close

I want to help build AI systems that work measurably better. My approach combines
practical engineering with systematic thinking about what makes AI genuinely useful.

**Acknowledge the gap:** No formal research credentials. Lead with production systems
that demonstrate rigorous thinking. Target Applied AI or Product teams rather than pure
research roles.
