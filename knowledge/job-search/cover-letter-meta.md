# Cover Letter Template - Meta AI (FAIR)

## Hook

Everything I've built is open source. MCP Hubby (Apache 2.0), ai-coding-config (Apache
2.0), machina (Apache 2.0), heart-centered-prompts (Apache 2.0). I believe the best AI
infrastructure should be available to everyone—that's why I ship in the open.

## Credibility

25-year Silicon Valley veteran. Self-taught. Multiple CTO roles, including ChangeTip
(acquired by Airbnb). Production systems managing real capital. Since 2023, I've focused
entirely on AI infrastructure—building the tools that make AI development more
accessible.

## Why Meta AI

You're shipping open models that compete with the best proprietary systems. That takes a
different kind of commitment—building in public, accepting contributions, iterating
openly. That's how I work.

My portfolio demonstrates this:

- **100K+ lines of production code** across open source projects
- **1,500+ commits** in public repositories
- **Production-grade infrastructure** available to anyone

## Proof Points

- **MCP Hubby**: Production MCP gateway. 25 service adapters. 713 commits, 87 test
  files. Apache 2.0 licensed.
- **ai-coding-config**: Claude Code plugin ecosystem. 24 agents, 18 commands, 33 rules.
  Works across Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline.
- **Carmenta**: Multi-model AI platform. Works with Llama alongside Claude and GPT—I
  build for the multi-model future.

## Close

I want to help build AI infrastructure that's available to everyone. Open source isn't
just a licensing choice for me—it's how I think great AI tools should be built. Meta AI
is doing that at scale.

**Customize for specific role:** Emphasize open source contributions and collaborative
development. De-emphasize heart-centered philosophy—lead with pragmatic building and
shipping.
